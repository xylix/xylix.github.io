# How and why I made this blog

The codebase was forked from [github.com/haihala/haihala.github.io](https://github.com/haihala/haihala.github.io/)

You can see the original authors cool story about making the blog at [https://haihala.github.io/blog/blog-meta](blog-meta).

I have been using Ghost for my blog since ~2018, but it recently had some critical vulnerabilities and I didn't want to go through the major version upgrade process that would've been necessary to update, so here we are. The only place where I have previously used Svelte was for my CV, which I also forked. It will eventually be hosted here.

I ended up spending a few hours manually copying Ghost blog posts over, but I could have probalby used a markdown export just as well.
